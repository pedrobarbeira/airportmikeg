This is the repository for the 2021 Algorithms and Data Strucutres semestral group project. 
This course is part of the Bachelor in Informatics Engineering, at FEUP - Porto, Portugal.

The project consists of designing a management system for an airline company. We decided on
the name Mike G since this artist is a well known meme at our school - thus adding a layer
of harmless fun to the inherent seriousness of the project.

The management system follows the guidelines provided by our faculty members, thus forcing
us to work with differente ADT's - some of which we, being only second-year students, aren't 
accustomed to just yet. 

It was given us room to be creative and further develop the project with custom features,
provided the guideline's objectives are met. We chose Git as our Vcs as a means to get a 
feel of what it's like to use this VCS in a real, multi-membered project. It has nothing
to do witht he fact this is the only VCS we (hardly) know. This way we get to experience 
the many intricacies of the system first hand, while creating a chance to deal with common 
industry problems such as merge conflicts and pull requests.

We hope the person reading this finds our project interesting, at the very least. While
still quite inexperienced, we all find great joy in programming, hoping to one day hack
the Internet away and, if all goes well, become the rulers of this planet we call Earth.
Hopefully these lines will show to you the depths of our knowledge. If we can achieve this
level of quality with the limited resources and experience we have, imagine what we'll do
by the time we finish our Masters.

Resistance is futile.
